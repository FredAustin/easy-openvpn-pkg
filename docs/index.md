# Overview

The easy-openvpn snap is designed to be deployed with as little configuration 
& setup as possible for spot deployment of secure yet disposable OpenVPN instances.
It's developed based on [docker-openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) project.  


This snap contains management scripts that simplify PKI and client management for fast, cheap and disposable VPNs. 

* A single command to set up server, create/revoke clients.
* A single command to connect to server.
* Easy configurable and manageable.
