# Overview

The easy-openvpn snap is designed to be deployed with as little configuration 
and setup as possible for spot deployment of secure yet disposable OpenVPN instances.
It's developed based on the [docker-openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) project.


This snap contains management scripts that simplify [PKI](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#pki) and client management for fast, cheap and disposable VPNs.

* A single command to set up the server, create/revoke clients.
* A single command to connect to the server.
* Easy to configure and manage.
